Cephadm
=======

Cephadm deploys and manages a Ceph cluster by connection to hosts from the
manager daemon via SSH to add, remove, or update Ceph daemon containers.  It
does not rely on external configuration or orchestration tools like Ansible,
Rook, or Salt.

Cephadm starts by bootstrapping a tiny Ceph cluster on a single node
(one monitor and one manager) and then uses the orchestration
interface ("day 2" commands) to expand the cluster to include all
hosts and to provision all Ceph daemons and services.  This can be
performed via the Ceph command-line interface (CLI) or dashboard
(GUI).

Cephadm is new in the Octopus v15.2.0 release and does not support older
versions of Ceph.
